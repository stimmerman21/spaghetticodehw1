# Refractoring HW

This assignment revolved around refractoring code to make it easier to read and improving the overall quality. I made multiple changes such as tag changes to resemble more HTML5 properties. With this I mostly focused on the <div> tags replacing them with others such as section, main, source, and aside.

The other major change that was made was condencing and simplifify the classes and not having as much repitition of the same code. For example the "benefit" class had many seperate css tags so consolidating them into one tag eliminated many lines of unnecessary code.
